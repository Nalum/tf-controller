# Integrate with Flux Receivers and Alerts

You can customize your Flux installation to use Flux API
resources like `Receivers` and `Alerts` with third-party custom
resource definitions such as the `Terraform` API CRD.

You will need to add a patch to the `kustomization.yaml` in your Flux cluster
installation's bootstrap manifests. Find it under the `flux-system` directory.

### Enable Notifications for Third-Party Controllers

Enable notifications for 3rd party Flux controllers such as [tf-controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller):
